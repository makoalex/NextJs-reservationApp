      We believe that good food goes beyond good taste. Nordvegan is
      not just a vegan food business (even though our food is pretty
      delicious!), it is a global calling to the people of the world
      asking them to help protect our beautiful planet while enjoying
      our equally beautiful food and living a more sustainable
      lifestyle. Our deli-style restaurant can be found in the local
      downtown area of Oslo, and serves up healthy plant-based food
      full of nutrient-dense ingredients. Whether you pop in for lunch
      or enjoy a hearty dinner, you can enjoy fresh vegan meals from a
      menu designed by a Michelin-star-trained chef â€“ so you know it
      will be of the highest quality. As well as proving that vegan
      food can be tasty as well as nutritious, we also help educate
      people on how to make constructive changes to eating habits,
      daily activities and more sustainable living. Stop by today and
      know you are supporting a true passion project, as well as doing
      your bit to help avert the global warming crisis.
